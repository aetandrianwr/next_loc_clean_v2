    "The MHSA baseline in DIY already achieves 63% of the theoretical copy-bound, leaving only 31% room for pointer mechanism improvement.",
    "In contrast, Geolife's MHSA only achieves 40% of copy-bound, leaving 51% room for pointer mechanism.",
    "Geolife users visit 47 unique locations on average vs DIY's 30, making user-specific pattern capture more valuable.",
    "The pointer mechanism's advantage is not about whether target is in history (both ~84%), but whether MHSA can already learn to copy it.",
    "DIY's more concentrated user behavior patterns are easier for standard attention to capture implicitly."
  ],
  "conclusion": "The performance gap difference between Geolife (+20.79%) and DIY (+3.68%) is primarily explained by \nhow much 'room for improvement' exists over the MHSA baseline.\n\nIn DIY dataset:\n- The MHSA baseline already achieves 63.2% of the theoretical copy-bound\n- Users visit fewer unique locations (29.8 vs 47.0)\n- Patterns are simpler and more predictable by standard attention\n- Result: Pointer mechanism only adds 3.68% because MHSA already captures most of the value\n\nIn Geolife dataset:\n- The MHSA baseline only achieves 39.6% of the theoretical copy-bound\n- Users visit more diverse locations\n- User-specific patterns are harder for generation head to memorize\n- Result: Pointer mechanism adds 20.79% by explicitly enabling copy from history\n\nThe Pointer mechanism excels when:\n1. MHSA baseline struggles to learn copy behavior implicitly\n2. User behavior is diverse and user-specific\n3. There is significant 'gap' between baseline and theoretical copy-bound"
