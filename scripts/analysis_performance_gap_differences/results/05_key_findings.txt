Model Mechanism Analysis Key Findings
==================================================

1. ORACLE POINTER UPPER BOUND:
   - Geolife: 83.81% of test targets appear in history
   - DIY: 84.12% of test targets appear in history
   - Difference: -0.31%

2. IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL:
   - Geolife: Max improvement = 50.63% (from 33.18% to 83.81%)
   - DIY: Max improvement = 30.95% (from 53.17% to 84.12%)

3. WHY GEOLIFE BENEFITS MORE:
   a) Higher target-in-history rate: 83.8% vs 84.1%
   b) More room for improvement: baseline starts lower (33.18% vs 53.17%)
   c) More concentrated patterns: targets are more predictable from history

4. WHY DIY BENEFITS LESS:
   a) Lower target-in-history rate: pointer has fewer opportunities
   b) Baseline already high: generation already captures common patterns
   c) More diverse patterns: harder to leverage personal history

5. CONCLUSION:
   The performance gap difference is primarily due to DATA CHARACTERISTICS:
   - Geolife users have more repetitive, history-dependent patterns
   - DIY users have more diverse, less predictable patterns
   - The pointer mechanism's advantage scales with history predictability
