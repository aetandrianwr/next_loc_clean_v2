The improvement difference (+20.78% in Geolife vs +3.71% in DIY)
is explained by TWO INTERACTING FACTORS:

1. SIMILAR ORACLE CEILING:
   Both datasets have ~84% target-in-history rate.
   → The pointer mechanism has SIMILAR opportunity in both datasets.

2. DIFFERENT BASELINE FLOORS:
   Geolife MHSA: 33.18% (leaves 50.6% room)
   DIY MHSA:     53.17% (leaves 31.0% room)
   → Geolife has 1.6x MORE room for improvement!

WHY MHSA BASELINE DIFFERS:
- DIY has 20x more training data → better generalization
- DIY test targets are 95.9% seen in training vs 76.4% for Geolife → easier test set
- DIY users have simpler target distributions (27 vs 43 unique targets per user)

CONCLUSION:
The pointer mechanism improves BOTH datasets by similar amounts RELATIVE to their potential:
- Geolife: realized 41.0% of improvement potential
- DIY: realized 12.0% of improvement potential

The ABSOLUTE improvement difference (20.78% vs 3.71%) 
is primarily because:
1. Geolife baseline starts much lower (more room to improve)
2. MHSA struggles more with Geolife's smaller dataset and diverse user patterns
3. Pointer mechanism fills the gap by directly leveraging input history
