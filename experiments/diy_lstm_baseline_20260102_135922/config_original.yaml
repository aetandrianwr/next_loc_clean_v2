# LSTM Baseline Model Configuration for DIY Dataset
# Dataset: diy_eps50_prev7
# 
# This baseline is designed to show the advantage of Pointer V45's design:
# - LSTM uses only location and user embeddings (no temporal features)
# - Pointer V45 uses attention, pointer mechanism, and rich temporal features
#
# This demonstrates that:
# 1. Pointer mechanism improves accuracy by copying from history
# 2. Temporal features (time, weekday, recency, duration) are important
# 3. Attention mechanism captures long-range dependencies better than LSTM
#
# Expected performance: Acc@1 ~47-50% (vs Pointer V45's ~57%)
#
# Usage:
#   source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate mlenv
#   python scripts/baseline_lstm_rnn/train_baseline.py --config scripts/baseline_lstm_rnn/config_lstm_diy.yaml
