# RNN Baseline Model Configuration for GeoLife Dataset
# Dataset: geolife_eps20_prev7
# 
# This baseline is designed to show the advantage of Pointer Generator Transformer's design:
# - RNN uses only location and user embeddings (no temporal features)
# - Vanilla RNN (Elman RNN) - simplest recurrent baseline
#
# The vanilla RNN is expected to perform WORSE than LSTM due to:
# - Vanishing gradient problem
# - Limited long-term dependency modeling
# - No gating mechanism
#
# Expected performance: Acc@1 ~20-25% (lower than LSTM and much lower than Pointer Generator Transformer)
#
# Usage:
#   source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate mlenv
#   python scripts/baseline_lstm_rnn/train_baseline.py --config scripts/baseline_lstm_rnn/config_rnn_geolife.yaml
