# Geolife Dataset Configuration - H3 Version
# Uses Uber H3 hexagonal grid for location clustering instead of DBSCAN

dataset:
  name: "geolife"
  h3_resolution: 8  # H3 resolution (0-15, higher = finer grid). Resolution 8 ~= 461m edge length
  previous_day: [7]  # List of previous days for sequence generation

preprocessing:
  # Staypoint detection parameters
  staypoint:
    gap_threshold: 1440  # 24 hours in minutes
    dist_threshold: 200  # Distance threshold in meters
    time_threshold: 30   # Time threshold in minutes
    activity_time_threshold: 25  # Activity flag threshold in minutes
  
  # H3 location clustering parameters
  location:
    num_samples: 2  # Minimum samples (staypoints) required in H3 cell to be valid location
  
  # User quality filter
  quality_filter:
    day_filter: 50  # Minimum tracking days
    window_size: 10  # Sliding window size for quality calculation
  
  # Duration truncation (in minutes)
  max_duration: 2880  # 2 days (60 * 24 * 2)
  
  # Sequence generation
#   min_sequence_length: 3  # Minimum sequence length (history + target) # static set to 3 as the original paper
  
  # Train/validation/test split ratios (per user)
  split:
    train: 0.6
    val: 0.2
    test: 0.2
