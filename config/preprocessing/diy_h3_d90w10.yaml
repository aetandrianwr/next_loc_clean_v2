# DIY Dataset Configuration - H3 Version
# Uses Uber H3 hexagonal grid for location clustering instead of DBSCAN

dataset:
  name: "diy_d90w10"
  h3_resolution: 8  # H3 resolution (0-15, higher = finer grid). Resolution 8 ~= 461m edge length
  previous_day: [3, 7, 10, 14]  # List of previous days for sequence generation

preprocessing:
  # H3 location clustering parameters
  location:
    num_samples: 2  # Minimum samples (staypoints) required in H3 cell to be valid location
  
  # Staypoint merging parameters
  staypoint_merging:
    max_time_gap: "1min"  # Maximum time gap for merging consecutive staypoints
  
  # User quality filter
  quality_filter:
    day_filter: 90  # Minimum tracking days
    window_size: 10  # Sliding window size (weeks) for quality calculation
    min_thres: 0.6  # Minimum quality threshold
    mean_thres: 0.7  # Mean quality threshold
  
  # Duration truncation (in minutes)
  max_duration: 2880  # 2 days - 1 (60 * 24 * 2)
  
  # Sequence generation
  min_sequence_length: 3  # Minimum sequence length (history + target)
  
  # Train/validation/test split ratios (per user)
  split:
    train: 0.8
    val: 0.1
    test: 0.1
